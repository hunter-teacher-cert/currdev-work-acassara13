Modeling 12th Grade, completed CSP
NetLogo - Python
Code is written to create simulations.
Difficulty - 6-7
Strengths - create engaging and meaningful simulations and/or models.
Weaknesses - This program will be hard to differentiate - I am not sure how to fix this - Maybe create mild and spicy projects.
Modeling could be used for career development and meaningful instruction.
