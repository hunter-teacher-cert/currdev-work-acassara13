Dear students, parents, and staff of Anonymous New York Public School:

It has come to our attention that some NYC schools are implementing a COVID-19 contact tracing app, where users are required to grant the app permission to their GPS location at all times. We believe that this is against the students’ privacy rights and we will not engage with the contact tracing program. Students should not have to worry about data being collected about their whereabouts.

However, we still highly prioritize the students’ health and wellbeing and hope that they can stay in school as long as possible without being disrupted by the highly contagious nature of COVID-19. We encourage students to be honest and immediately communicative if they do test positive, or even if they feel any symptoms, as an act of precaution. We will enforce proper mask mandates and social distancing, and ensure that all classrooms and hallways are regularly sanitized and provided with proper sanitation materials.

Instead of using location based contact tracing, we will use traditional contact tracing. If a student tests positive, we will notify anyone who shared a classroom with them within the 5 days that they tested positive that they were exposed. In addition, we will conduct a thorough investigation with the student to identify any other individuals with whom they have made close contact with during the potential period of contagion. We will provide rapid tests for those students and staff so that they can regularly check if they are infected, and continue to closely monitor the situation.

Should this method prove inefficient or ineffective, we will consider the possibility of a GPS-based method of contact tracing that doesn’t infringe on students’ privacy rights. We hope that we can continue to thrive in this learning environment with minimal disruptions and that you and your family stay safe and healthy in these unprecedented times.

In community,
